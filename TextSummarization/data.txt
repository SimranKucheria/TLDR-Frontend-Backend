Today: To win over a single Democratic senator, President Biden is planning to drop the most powerful plan to confront climate change from his congressional agenda. I spoke with my colleague Coral Davenport about why that is, the blowback it has unleashed, and what it means for the future of U.S. climate policy.

It’s Wednesday, October 20.

Coral, the last time you were on the show, back in April, you described to our colleague Astead Herndon the Biden administration’s plan to tackle climate change, and how the president and congressional Democrats were betting that they could incorporate this plan into their sweeping social safety net and infrastructure bill. So remind us about that proposal.

Sure. So this plan really has been at the heart of President Biden’s climate agenda since he came into office. So this program, it’s called the Clean Electricity Program. It’s targeted at the generation of electricity, which is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the U.S. First largest source is vehicles. So you have thousands and thousands of electric power plants all across the country. Most of them are powered by coal and natural gas.
